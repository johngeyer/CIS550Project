########## TRANSLATED SQL QUERIES FROM MILESTONE 1 #############

1) Who led the league in homeruns each year? What about between years Y1 and Y2?

SELECT b.name, b.year FROM Batting b
WHERE b.HR IN (SELECT MAX(b2.HR) FROM Batting b2 WHERE b2.year=b.year)

If we want to look just at a specific range of years, we'd add the condition
"AND b.year <= Y2 AND b.year >= Y1"'

2) What are the single season and career records for a given stat?

For the RBI statistic, the queries are: 

// Single season record
SELECT MAX(b.RBI) FROM Batting b  

// Career record
SELECT MAX(career_rbi) FROM 
	(SELECT COUNT(b.RBI) AS career_rbi
	 FROM Batting b
	 GROUP BY Player_id)

3) Of players with at least X plate appearances, who had the highest ratio of stat Y to stat Z

SELECT b.name, b.Y/b.Z AS ratio 
FROM Batting b
WHERE b.PA >= X and b.Y/b.Z = (SELECT MAX(b1.Y/b1.Z) FROM Batting b1)

4) Show me a list of all players with at most 100 plate appearances, at most 50 strikeouts, and who had at least 20 homeruns? 

SELECT b.name 
FROM Batting b
WHERE b.PA <= 100 AND b.SO <= 50 AND b.HR >= 20

5) Which rookies had the best strikeout to walk ratio?

SELECT b.name, b.SO/b.BB AS ratio
FROM Batting b
WHERE b.year = (SELECT MIN(b1.year) 
				FROM Batting b1 
				WHERE b1.player_id=b.player_id)
ORDER BY b.SO/b.BB DESC

6) How many players each year hit over 40 homeruns? 

SELECT COUNT(*), b.year 
FROM Batting b
WHERE b.HR > 40
GROUP BY b.year

7) Who are the players who have hit 80 extra base hits in a season? Order them by number of times they have completed the feat. 

SELECT b.Player_id, b.name, COUNT(b.year)
FROM Batting b
WHERE b.2B + b.3B + b.HR >= 80
GROUP BY b.Player_id
ORDER BY COUNT(b.year) DESC

8) Who had the highest exit-velocity to home-run ratio? The worst?

So we ended up not including the statcast data set (which had information
about exit velocities) so this query will not be possible on our 
application. 

9) How does launch angle correlate with number of home runs hit?

This isn't really an SQL query. We presented this as a possible question
that could be answered by our web application. 

10) Which active pitchers who have at least 1000 career strikeouts have the
highest spin rate this season?

Again, we didn't include the statcast data set, and hence we don't have
access to spin-rates. Thus this query will not be answered by our application.

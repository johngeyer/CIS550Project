PLEASE NOTE: Because hosting a Neo4J instance on AWS required money, we chose to host it 
locally. Please see the cypher .CYP files in the "input_files_final" directory to see our imported
data. See the "graph.png" file for a picture of a subgraph of this database. 

Nodes:

	Player(name)
	Team(teamID, abbr)

Edges: 

	PAYS(salary, season)

Index on Player(name) (see the file "ANA_input.cyp" for where we create this index)
